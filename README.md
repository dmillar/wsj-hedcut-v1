### Wall Street Journal Hedcut Style for Stable Diffusion
Readers of the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) are familiar with the distinctive style used to create portaits of their writers and subjects. This is a fine-tuned stable
diffusion model that can be used to create hedcut-styled images using the prompt **_wsj hedcut of \<subject\>_**. This model can also be used in a DreamBooth environment
to train a face or other subject for custom and unique hedcuts.
